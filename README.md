This example extends the amazing work done by vmunier:
- refactored to focus on the main app as root project with a javascript client module (see vumnier project for complete shared code ex)
- using LAB async javascript loader which is best practice for optimal performance
- using digest asset versioning which I feel is necessary for production apps
